{"name":"Asagi","tagline":"Asagi imageboard dumper","body":"Asagi is a reimplementation of Fuuka's dumper side in Java. It allows you to dump and archive posts, images and all relevant data from imageboards into a local database and local image store (at the moment, only 4chan is supported).\r\n\r\nTo provide a frontend for said data (providing a web interface to use it as an archive is the usual reason to use a program like this to begin with), you'll have to use [fuuka](/eksopl/fuuka) or even [foolfuuka](/FoOlRulez/FoOlFuuka). \r\n\r\nThe first goal was to reach feature parity with Fuuka's dumper. New features and enhancements are to follow next.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nAsagi is now mostly ready for public consumption. However, Asagi is storing image files and thumbnails according to a new directory configuration that doesn't save duplicates, so it's only currently compatible with foolfuuka, not vanilla fuuka, because fuuka's database schema is still behind. You can [download release 0.2 here](/eksopl/asagi/downloads) (released Aug 30 2012).\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIts short term goals are to:\r\n\r\n* Be efficient\r\n* Be resilient to network weirdness, bad data and other bad behavior\r\n* Be clearly written\r\n* Follow Fuuka's internal structure as much as possible\r\n\r\nIts long term goals are to eventually be:\r\n\r\n* Extendable to other imageboards\r\n* Extendable to other means of data feeding (local rather than HTTP, for example)\r\n\r\nIt uses:\r\n\r\n* MySQL Connector/J to talk to MySQL\r\n* PostgreSQL JDBC Driver to talk to PostgreSQL\r\n* Apache HttpComponents to perform HTTP requests\r\n* Joda Time to be able to do anything with dates in Java without losing one's sanity\r\n* Gson to read the configuration file\r\n* Guava for small extras that are nice to have here and there\r\n* JNA to be able to perform chown/chmod/getgrnam on Unix platforms\r\n* Maven for dependency resolution and building\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n### Why would you do this?\r\nFuuka's dumper is a bit too memory hungry. This was a result out of a frustrating afternoon trying to figure out how to make Fuuka's dumper use less memory. At the end, I was only able to shave off something like 10 MiB. This can be a pain for people that wish to run many dumpers at the same time. Also, while Perl is great for a lot of things, it's not the best choice when it comes to doing things with threads. And yes, I'm saying that I rewrote something in Java to save memory. Stop laughing.\r\n\r\n### No seriously, why Java?\r\nI can write Java in cruise control mode without having to think too hard, so it made for an amusing passtime for a while. Plus, Java threads and concurrent data structures are adequate to what I needed.\r\n\r\n### JSON for the configuration file?\r\nI just couldn't think of any good markup language for the configuration file. Amazing, isn't it?\r\n\r\n* XML is the worst thing to happen to the world of software engineering, and if you think XML is good, then I don't want to have this discussion with you.\r\n* YAML, while well intended, is completely unusuable for configuration files due to its whitespace sensitivity. While you can specify a language with forced indentation of code and have programmers happy with it, you cannot reasonably expect a regular user that just wants to get software working to know (or care) about indentation, spaces vs tabs, etc.\r\n* Java property files are pretty simple. Unfortunatly, they're too simple -- they're restricted to latin1 and they don't support lists. Even if you try to get around those limitations by using Apache Commons Configuration, you still can't get lists inside lists, which I needed.\r\n* INI files, as with Java property files, actually have a reasonable format overall, but they have the same issue as property files. On top of that, their grammar and syntax isn't well defined by anything or anyone.\r\n* JSON is pretty okay. It falls short because its grammar is overly strict to be used in configuration files, in my opinion. Forgetting a comma will mean trouble, inserting an extra comma: likewise. Its huge gotcha is that it has no way of inserting comments, unacceptable for most configuration files.\r\n* I'm sure there's tons of really good markup languages out there, but unfortunatly, they're either not very popular (which means that it's going to be hard to find a module/library/extension/plugin to deal with it in pretty much every environment), or I just haven't heard of them.\r\n\r\nSo out of all of those, even after weighing downsides, I ended up with JSON.\r\n\r\n### What's with the name?\r\nAsagi is the eldest of the Ayase sisters. Fuuka is the middle sister. The Ayase family lives next door to Yotsuba. Get it?\r\n\r\n### I have a question not listed here\r\nYou can email eksopl at gmail with your question.
